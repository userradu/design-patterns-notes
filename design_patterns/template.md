# The Template Method Pattern

The Template Method defines the steps of an algorithm and allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps. 

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing he algorithm's structure.

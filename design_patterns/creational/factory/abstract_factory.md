# Abstract factory

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Use this pattern when you have families of products you need to create and you want to make sure your clients create products that belong together. 

Uses object composition: object creation is implemented in methods exposes in the factory interface.
